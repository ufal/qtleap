# Easier QTLeap

The purpose of these scripts is to make life easier for developers working on
QTLeap.

Comments and suggestions for improvement are very welcome
(<luis.gomes@di.fc.ul.pt>).

## Usage Examples

For all the following commands the `$QTLEAP_CONF` variable must be defined in
 the environment. This value in this variable has three components separated
 by a forward slash (`/`):

  1. the language pair (in the form of `L1-L2`);
  2. the training dataset name;
  3. the date when the transfer models were trained (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`)

Example:  `QTLEAP_CONF=en-pt/ep/2015-02-12`

The two languages must be lexicographically ordered (`en-pt` is OK, `pt-en` is
 not). The same configuration identifier is used for both translation directions.
According to the `$QTLEAP_CONF` variable defined above, the file
 `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/datasets/en-pt/ep.sh` must exist (see
 [Dataset Configuration](#dataset-configuration) section below for
 further details). The date suffix (in this case `2015-02-12`) indicates when
 the transfer models were trained.

### Training

Training transfer models (both translation directions are trained in parallel):

    qtleap train

The training process will create several files and sub-directories within the
current directory, so generally *you want to run this command on a newly
created directory*.  For example, when training models for English-Portuguese,
the following files and directories are created:

    .
    ├── [*] about.txt    # contains versioning information and $QTLEAP_CONF
    ├── [*] qtleap.stat  # output of "hg stat" on $QTLEAP_ROOT repository
    ├── [*] qtleap.diff  # unified diff of the $QTLEAP_ROOT repository
    ├── [*] tectomt.stat # output of "svn stat" on the $TMT_ROOT repository
    ├── [*] tectomt.diff # unified diff of the $TMT_ROOT repository
    ├── dataset_files/   # downloaded from central share server
    ├── corpus/          # plain text split into chunks of 200 sentences
    ├── lemmas.gz        # GIZA input files
    ├── giza/            # GIZA itermediate files
    ├── alignments.gz    # GIZA final alignments
    ├── en2pt/           # models for EN to PT transfer
    │   ├── formemes/
    │   │   ├── [*] maxent.model.gz
    │   │   └── [*] static.model.gz
    │   ├── lemmas/
    │   │   ├── [*] maxent.model.gz
    │   │   └── [*] static.model.gz
    │   └── vectors/     # input for machine learning
    ├── pt2en/           # models for PT to EN transfer
    │   ├── formemes/
    │   │   ├── [*] maxent.model.gz
    │   │   └── [*] static.model.gz
    │   ├── lemmas/
    │   │   ├── [*] maxent.model.gz
    │   │   └── [*] static.model.gz
    │   └── vectors/     # input for machine learning
    ├── atrees/          # analytical-level trees
    └── ttrees/          # tectogrammatical-level trees

Here's the contents of `about.txt`:

    QTLEAP_CONF=en-pt/ep/2015-02-12
    QTLEAP_ROOT_REV=139:f0dc245ff992
    TMT_ROOT_REV=14390
    LXSUITE_REV=143:e55fc226cb4d

When training is finished, the files prefixed with `[*]` in the above tree are
automatically uploaded to the share server into the directory
`$upload_ssh_path/$QTLEAP_CONF`.  See [Sharing Configuration](#upload_ssh_)
section for details about `$upload_ssh_path` and related variables.

### Translation

Translating from English to Portuguese (reads one sentence per line from
 `STDIN` and writes one sentence per line on `STDOUT`):

    qtleap translate en pt

If you want to save the trees of each translated sentence (for debugging
purposes for example), then give a directory name as argument:

    qtleap translate en pt trees_dir

This will read from `STDIN` and write to `STDOUT` as previously, but it will
also create a file named `trees_dir/###.treex.gz` for each input line (`###`
is replaced by the number of the line, starting with `001`).


### Evaluation

Evaluating the current pipeline on a specific evaluation set (in this example
 `qtleap_2a`):

    qtleap evaluate en pt qtleap_2a

For this command to succeed the file
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/testsets/en-pt/qtleap_2a.sh` must exist and define a
variable named `testset_files` as described below in
[Testset Configuration](#testset-configuration) section.

A new directory `eval_qtleap_2a` will be created in the current directory with
the following structure:

    .
    └── eval_qtleap_2a
        ├── about.txt               # contains versioning information
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.bleu    # output of `mteval-v13a.pl`
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.cache.treex.gz # trees before synthesis stage
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.final.treex.gz # final trees
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.html    # original, reference and MT side by side
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.ngrams  #
        ├── qtleap_2a.en2pt.resume  # output of Print::TranslationResume
        ├── qtleap_2a.en.txt        # original English text
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt_mt.txt     # machine translated (English to Portuguese)
        └── qtleap_2a.pt.txt        # original Portuguese text

If you then evaluate on the other direction (Portuguese to English):

    qtleap evaluate pt en qtleap_2a

The following files will be added to the directory:

    .
    └── eval_qtleap_2a
        ...
        ├── qtleap_2a.en_mt.txt     # machine translated (Portuguese to English)
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt2en.bleu    # output of `mteval-v13a.pl`
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt2en.cache.treex.gz # trees before synthesis stage
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt2en.final.treex.gz # final trees
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt2en.html    # original, reference and MT side by side
        ├── qtleap_2a.pt2en.ngrams  #
        └── qtleap_2a.pt2en.resume  # output of Print::TranslationResume

To evaluate the current pipeline on all evaluation sets listed in
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/testsets/en-pt` just omit the evalset name:

    qtleap evaluate en pt

#### Cleaning cached intermediate trees

If you are developing the synthesis and you want to re-evaluate the pipeline you
just repeat the above commands to re-synthesize the translations.

The re-runs will be much faster than the first evaluation because
`qtleap_evaluate` will reuse the previously created `*.cache.treex.gz` files
(which contain the trees after analysis and transfer), and only the synthesis
step is done.

*However, if you have changed the analysis or transfer steps*, then you should
remove the cached trees by running:

    qtleap clean

This will clean the cached trees for all configured testsets that have been
already evaluated in the current directory.

### Snapshots

A snapshot is a bundle of current evaluations together with all information
needed to recover the exact state of the current pipeline.

#### Creating a snapshot

To create a snapshot first you must ensure that all configured testsets have
been evaluated using the current `$QTLEAP_CONF` for both translation directions.
Then you may run:

    qtleap save "brief description of what changed since last snapshot"

This command will create a new directory `snapshots/YYYY-MM-DDL` (year, month,
day, and a letter) within the current directory and it will copy all current
evaluations into it.

The value of the `$QTLEAP_CONF` variable is saved into `about.txt` within the
snapshot directory, as well as the current mercurial and SVN revision numbers
of `$QTLEAP_ROOT` and `$TMT_ROOT` respectively, and the current revision of
the remote lxsuite service.

Furthermore, uncommited changes to the `$QTLEAP_ROOT` and `$TMT_ROOT`
repositories are also saved in the form of a unified diff (`qtleap.diff` and
`tectomt.diff`), allowing us to recover the current source code in full extent.

*WARNING*: only files already tracked by mercurial and SVN will be included in
the unified diff of every snapshot, ie, all files appearing with a question
mark when you issue the commands `hg status` or `svn status` *WILL NOT* be
included in the diff.

The snapshot is also uploaded to the configured share server, making it readily
available for comparison and analysis to other users.
The URL of a snapshot is
`$download_http_base_url/snapshots/LANGPAIR/DATASET/YYYY-MM-DDL`, where
`$download_http_base_url` is a configuration variable described in
[Sharing Configuration](#sharing-configuration), and `LANGPAIR` and `DATASET`
are the first two components of `$QTLEAP_CONF`.

#### Listing snapshots
Listing all saved snapshots, from the most recent to the oldest:

    qtleap list

This will fetch an updated list of snapshots from the share server for the
current `$QTLEAP_CONF`.  The list is presented as follows:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Snapshot      | en2pt | pt2en | Description
    ---------------|-------|-------|----------------------------------------
     * 2015-02-09a | 12.81 |  6.27 | added some exceptions to the rules
       2015-02-02a |  9.56 |  4.69 | some reordering rules for noun phrases
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns `en2pt` and `pt2en` show the average BLEU scores over all configured
evalsets for both translation directions.
Snapshots marked with an asterisk (`*`) exist both locally and on the server.
Unmarked snapshots exist only on the server.


#### Comparing snapshots
To compare current translations/evaluations with the ones from last snapshot:

    qtleap compare

To compare current translations/evaluations with a specific snapshot (in this
case 2015-01-20):

    qtleap compare 2015-01-20

Note: if the specified snapshot does not exist locally (ie, it does not appear
marked with an asterisk in the list of snapshots), then the comparison will take
longer because the snapshot will be automatically downloaded from the server.


## Configuration


All configuration files are kept in directory `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf`.

### Environment Configuration

The shell environment is configured by sourcing
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/env/default.sh` from your `~/.bashrc` as follows:

    source $HOME/code/qtleap/conf/env/default.sh

This file defines and exports the following variables: `QTLEAP_ROOT`,
`TMT_ROOT`, `TREEX_CONFIG`, `PATH`, and `PERL5LIB`. If you installed the
qtleap and tectomt repositories into the recommended place
(`~/code/qtleap` and `~/code/tectomt`), then you don't have to change this
file. Else, you should create a file with your username
(`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/env/$USER.sh`) and source it from your `~/.bashrc` like
this:

    source $QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/env/$USER.sh

### Host Configuration
The file `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/hosts/$(hostname).sh` will be used if it exists,
else the file `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/hosts/default.sh` is used instead.
Either of these files must define the following variables:

#### \$num_procs
The maximum number of concurrent processes that should be executed. Specify a
number lower than the number of available processors in your machine.
(default: `2`)

#### \$sort_mem
How much memory can we use for sorting? (default: 50%)

#### \$big_machine
Set this to `true` only if your machine has enough memory to run several
concurrent analysis pipelines (for example a machine with 32 cores and 256 GB
RAM).  (default: `false`)

#### \$giza_dir
Where GIZA++ has been installed.
(default: `"$TMT_ROOT/share/installed_tools/giza"`)


### Sharing Configuration

Corpora and transfer models are downloaded/uploaded automatically, without
user intervention.  All data is stored in a central server, which is
configured in `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/sharing.sh`:

#### \$upload_ssh_*
These variables configure SSH access for automatic uploading of transfer models
after training.
Example:

    upload_ssh_user="lgomes"
    upload_ssh_host="nlx-server.di.fc.ul.pt"
    upload_ssh_port=22
    upload_ssh_path="public_html/qtleap/share"

#### \$download_http_*
These variables configure HTTP access for automatic downloading of datasets,
testsets, and transfer models as needed.
Example:

    download_http_base_url="http://nlx-server.di.fc.ul.pt/~lgomes/qtleap/share"
    download_http_user="qtleap"
    download_http_password="xxxxxxxxxxx"

### Dataset Configuration

A dataset is a combination of parallel corpora that is used to train the
transfer models.  For each `DATASET` we must create a respective file
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/datasets/L1-L2/DATASET.sh` and it must define the following
variables:

#### \$dataset_files
A space-separated list of files (may be gzipped), each containing
tab-separated pairs of human translated sentences. The file paths specfied
here must be relative to `$download_base_url` configured in
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/sharing.sh`.

Example: `dataset_files="corpora/europarl/ep.enpt.gz"`

#### \$train_hostname
The hostname of the machine where the transfer models are to be trained. This
must be the exact string returned by the hostname command.  It is used as a
safety guard to prevent training on an under-resourced machine. You may use an
`*` to allow training of this dataset on any machine.

#### \$*_train_opts
These are the options affecting the behaviour of the machine learning
algorithm for training each transfer model.
Four variables must be defined: `$lemma_static_train_opts`,
`$lemma_maxent_train_opts`, `$formeme_static_train_opts`, and
`$formeme_maxent_train_opts`.
Refer to `$TMT_ROOT/treex/training/mt/transl_models/train.pl` for further
details.  Example:

    static_train_opts="--instances 10000 \
        --min_instances 2 \
        --min_per_class 1 \
        --class_coverage 1"

    maxent_train_opts="--instances 10000 \
        --min_instances 10 \
        --min_per_class 2 \
        --class_coverage 1 \
        --feature_column 2 \
        --feature_cut 2 \
        --learner_params 'smooth_sigma 0.99'"

    lemma_static_train_opts="$static_train_opts"
    formeme_static_train_opts="$static_train_opts"

    lemma_maxent_train_opts="$maxent_train_opts"
    formeme_maxent_train_opts="$maxent_train_opts"

#### \$rm_giza_files
If `true` then GIZA models are removed after the aligment is produced.


### Testset Configuration

A testset is a combination of parallel corpora that is used to test the
 whole pipeline.  For each `TESTSET` we must create a respective file
 `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/datasets/L1-L2/TESTSET.sh` and it must define the following variables:

#### \$testset_files
A space-separated list of files (may be gzipped), each containing
tab-separated pairs of human translated sentences.
The file paths specified here must be relative to `$download_base_url`
configured in `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/sharing.sh`.

Example: `testset_files="corpora/qtleap/qtleap_1a.gz"`


### Treex Configuration

Treex configuration for each user is kept in
`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/treex/$USER/config.yaml`.
If you wonder why we don't simply use `$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/treex/$USER.yaml`, it
is because Treex expects its configuration file to be named exactly
 `config.yaml`.

Here's my Treex configuration (`$QTLEAP_ROOT/conf/treex/luis/config.yaml`) for
guidance:
